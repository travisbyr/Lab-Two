# Lab-Two

1st day created calculations to practise, learnt about pre and post incrementing.
2nd day, a lot of math caculations, null, undefined, adding integers and strings, '==='

## Journel Entry 3

### What

This week we learnt more amount using mathematical equations. We did this by dong group coding, practising the use of javascript operators. We learnt about the variety of javascript opeartors that can be used, such as mathematical, comparable, logical bitwise and conditonal. We learnt how to effectivly implement these operators to create post and pre incrementing calculations that increments a integer variable. We also learnt about the meaning of null and undefined variables and what the calculation will show when comapred and added to integers and strings. We also learnt the use of or, and, equals and does not equal to operators.

### Why

The variety of javascript operators and good to learn as they can be used effetively to create applications. It is almost guaranteed that while creating an application that their will be a javascript operator used.
