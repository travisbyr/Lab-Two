# Lab-Two

1st day created calculations to practise, learnt about pre and post incrementing.
2nd day, a lot of math caculations, null, undefined, adding integers and strings, '==='

## Journel Entry 3

### What

This week we learnt more amount using mathematical equations. We did this by dong group coding, practising the use of javascript operators. We learnt about the variety of javascript opeartors that can be used, such as mathematical, comparable, logical bitwise and conditonal. We learnt how to effectivly implement these operators to create post and pre incrementing calculations that increments a integer variable. We also learnt about the meaning of null and undefined variables and what the calculation will show when comapred and added to integers and strings. We also learnt the use of or, and, equals and does not equal to operators.

### Why

The variety of javascript operators are good to learn as they can be used effetively to create applications. It is almost guaranteed that while creating an application that their will be a javascript operator used. By learnting these operators we are able to figure out solutions in functions and if statements accuratly and efficently.

### How

While learning this skill, we noticed that not all operators will work together, and depending on the data type used, somes operators will not work out the problem correctly. For example, when we try to compare an integer with an integer that is in a string, the calculation is true. But when we try to calculate the same calculation using a triple equals symbol (===) the calculation is false. This is we are comparing two variables that have a different data type. When a double/normal equals symbol is used (==), the integer in a string is ackknloedge as an integer regardless of whether its being classed as a string. Although for a triple equals symbole (===) the datatypes are represented as what they are being classed (e.g integers not in quotation marks are integers, integers in quotation marks are strings. This is because the triple equals symbol is called an 'identical operator', meaning it compares two variables that are identical, having the same properties and value. Where as the double equals symbole called the 'equal operator' only looks for data values that are equal to each other. An indentical operator compares using all the properties of the variable where an equal operator only compares using the value.
